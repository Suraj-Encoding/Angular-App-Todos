<!-- # Important Notes #  -->

<!-- 1. Files - Three types of files are there in angular
                 1. .html -> For Structure
                 2. .css  -> For Style
                 3. .ts   -> For Logic   -->

<!-- 2. TypeScript 
         - It is the main part of angular
         - It is one programming language
         - It is same like Javascript
         - extension is '.ts'
         - '.spec.ts' -> Testing file - We not focus on it right now
      -->

<!-- 3. When we create a new component in angular then in there html file by default 
        one paragraph is created with 
        <p> [component name] works! </p> -->
